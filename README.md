# Fukuhara Zemi ‚Äì Agent-Based Modeling & DAO Simulations (Spring 2024)

This repository contains NetLogo simulations and materials from Keio University's Fukuhara Zemi (Spring 2024), focused on applying **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** to philanthropic systems and decentralized organizations (DAOs). The project integrates **game theory**, **experimental economics**, and **token design** to evaluate how DAOs can improve donation mechanisms by reducing agency costs and enhancing incentive alignment.

## üîç Highlights

- **ONGAESHI DAO Simulation**  
  Models hybrid donation systems combining public/private goods and autonomous learning agents to explore effective DAO-based philanthropy mechanisms.

- **Principal-Agent & Game Theory Models**  
  Simulations explore how DAOs can mitigate agency problems via novel tokenomics (FT/NFT), governance rules, and incentive schemes.

- **Experimental Economics Integration**  
  Designed and prepared experimental setups to validate agent behaviors and donation efficiency in DAO environments.

## üß∞ Tools & Methods

- NetLogo (multi-agent simulation)
- Game theory frameworks (Jensen & Meckling, 1976; Boss & Sifat, 2023)
- Experimental design and data analysis
- DAO implementation references: ONGAESHI.io and ICIS 2019

## üéì Context

This project was conducted as part of the Spring 2024 seminar coursework, leading to:
- A publishable academic paper (junior team)
- An integrated thesis draft (senior team)
- Final presentations for internal and external academic audiences

## üìÑ Final Outputs

- NetLogo simulation files (by week and theme)
- Project report (10+ pages)
- Thesis drafts and experimental design plans
