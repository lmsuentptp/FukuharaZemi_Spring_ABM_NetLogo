3. Model Development: Using NetLogo, develop a multi-agent model that
simulates a financial market. Your model should include various agents whose
interactions lead to price changes. Consider incorporating elements such as:
• Different types of market participants (e.g., high-frequency traders,
long-term investors)
• Buy and sell orders that influence market prices
• External shocks or news events that affect market sentiment

4. Incorporate Price Fluctuations: Ensure your model realistically simulates price
fluctuations over time. This could involve simulating supply and demand
dynamics, market sentiment, or the impact of external events on prices.
5. Documentation: Document your model's design, including the assumptions
you've made about the financial market and the logic behind the interactions of
different agents. Explain how these interactions lead to price fluctuations within
your model.
6. Prepare for Presentation: Be ready to present your model to peers during the
retreat. Your presentation should include a demonstration of your model in
action, an explanation of its key components, and insights or hypotheses about
financial markets that your model helps to explore.

<Appendix>

Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate two innovative approaches for increasing donations:
shifting traditional models to a DAO framework and blending private with public goods
donations. We'll use game theory, a multi-agent model with relaxed rationality
assumptions, and the principal-agent problem to dissect the dynamics and inefficiencies
in philanthropy. Theoretical findings will be tested through experimental economics and
validated with a DAO project data for practical insights.

Scope and Methodology:

Grounded in the insights from seminal works, this project seeks to harness the potential
of blockchain technology for social good, employing a game theory framework to
address the complexities of philanthropic donations. Inspired by Boss and Sifat's
investigation into DAOs and agency costs ("Decentralizing the Firm: Can DAOs
Overcome Traditional Agency Costs?", ResearchGate, Dec 2023), and Hülsemann and
Tumasjan's analysis of token incentive structures ("Walk This Way! Incentive Structures
of Different Token Designs for Blockchain-Based Applications," ICIS 2019
Proceedings), our research is structured around the following objectives:

Development and Validation of a Hybrid Model: Utilizing a game theory framework, our
primary aim is to develop a hybrid model that integrates public and private goods,
incorporating both fungible and non-fungible tokens. This approach is designed to
explore innovative strategies for increasing donations towards social goods, with a focus
on overcoming the principal-agent problem. Success in this area will be measured by the
model's ability to accurately predict and enhance donation outcomes, validated through
both experimental economics studies and analysis of real DAO data.
Implementation of Multi-Agent Simulations: In line with the game theory framework, we
propose to use NetLogo software to develop multi-agent simulations that loosen the
rationality assumption of the game theory and reflect the complex decision-making
processes of donors and organizations. This methodology allows us to examine the
strategic interactions and incentive structures that influence philanthropic behavior,
moving beyond the traditional assumptions of game theory to include bounded
rationality and diverse motivations. Success will be quantified by the insights generated
from these simulations, particularly in terms of identifying effective donation strategies

within the DAO context.
Conducting Experimental Economics Studies: Building upon the theoretical foundation
provided by the game theory framework, we will empirically test the predictions of our
hybrid model through experimental economics studies with 20-50 examinees. This
innovative application aims to provide concrete data on how different incentive
structures, as informed by our game-theoretic analysis, impact donor behavior. The
success of these studies will be evidenced by their ability to empirically support the
effectiveness of our proposed model.
Analysis of Real DAO Data: To further validate our game-theoretic model and its
applicability to real-world philanthropy, we plan to analyze data from an actual DAO,
“ONGAESHI DAO,” engaged in philanthropic activities. This step will offer critical
insights into the practical effectiveness of our hybrid model and the strategic
considerations highlighted by our game theory analysis. Success in this domain will be
demonstrated by the alignment of our theoretical predictions with observed donation
patterns and outcomes in the DAO.

Significance:
By employing a game theory framework, this research is poised to make a significant
academic and practical contribution to the field of philanthropy. Our novel hybrid
model, supported by multi-agent simulations, experimental economics, and real-world
data analysis, seeks to advance our understanding of blockchain technology's role in
promoting social goods. Addressing the principal-agent problem within this framework,
our work aims to provide actionable insights for more efficient, transparent, and
impactful donations, representing a substantial innovation in the study of philanthropic
donations.

Methodology

Our methodology to achieve the research objectives is structured around a
comprehensive, multi-faceted approach that integrates theoretical frameworks,
simulation modeling, and empirical data analysis:
Theoretical Framework Establishment:
⚫ Begin with a thorough literature review to ground our research in existing theories
related to DAOs, the principal-agent problem, and game theory.
⚫ Develop a conceptual model that outlines the potential mechanisms through which
DAOs can address agency costs and enhance philanthropic efforts.
⚫ Conduct a thorough review of philanthropy's theoretical frameworks and engage in

an analysis of its practical implementations.
Multi-Agent Simulation Development:
⚫ Utilize NetLogo to create a multi-agent simulation that models the behavior of
various stakeholders within a DAO, including donors, recipients, and governance
bodies.
⚫ Design the simulation to test different market, mechanical, and token designs,
assessing their impact on agency costs, governance efficiency, and donor
engagement.
Empirical Data Collection and Analysis:
⚫ Collaborate with the ONGAESHI project to collect real-world data on customer
behavior, donation amounts, and agency costs.
⚫ Conduct surveys and interviews with DAOs and traditional organizations to gather
comparative data on organizational efficiency and stakeholder engagement.
⚫ Comparative Analysis and Model Validation:
⚫ Compare the outcomes of the NetLogo simulations with the empirical data
collected from ONGAESHI and other organizations.
⚫ Use statistical and econometric methods to validate the simulation model, ensuring
its accuracy and applicability to real-world scenarios.
Dissemination and Feedback Integration:
⚫ Share preliminary findings with the academic community and practitioners in the
field for feedback.
⚫ Refine our models and simulations based on feedback and additional data, aiming
for continuous improvement and accuracy.

By following this methodology, we aim to not only achieve our research objectives but
also contribute to the broader understanding of DAOs in the philanthropic sector.
